# Aptoosh -- Scan. Shop. Pay in a flash.
> A point-of-sale experience without traditional hardware, apps, or merchant accounts.

---

## ✨ Think of Aptoosh as:
> **“QR-native e-commerce — scan, pay, walk away.”**  
You don’t need a seller terminal. You don’t need a cashier. You don’t even need a website — just a QR code or link that launches the checkout flow.

## 🛍️ Core Concept
A **POS-like experience** (but without terminals, banks, or subscriptions) where physical or digital products can be purchased instantly.

- Combines **QR scanning** with **Aptos smart contract payments**
- Supports **optional credit card checkout**
- Designed to make **crypto payments feel as fast and intuitive as Apple Pay or Google Pay**

---

## 🔐 Security & Cryptography

- Delivery address and order list are **encrypted on the client** before being stored on-chain.
- Uses **asymmetric key encryption** derived from a buyer signature — only the seller and buyer can decrypt.
- **No servers, no databases, no logins** — just a client-side app + the **Aptos blockchain**.
- Smart contracts **enforce order lifecycle and payment rules**.

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Merchants selling **physical or digital goods**
- **Pop-up stores** or local marketplaces
- **Restaurants** or **takeaways** accepting crypto
- **Events** where users scan QR codes to pay for entry or items
- Printed or digital **promo materials** with instant “Add to Cart” and checkout

- Just **scan a QR**, pay, and walk away
- **No registration**, no merchant hardware, no backend infrastructure needed
